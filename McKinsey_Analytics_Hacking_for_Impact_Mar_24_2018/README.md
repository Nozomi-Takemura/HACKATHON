# Project Title

This repository contains the healthcare dataset and my data-analysis R-code used in the McKinsey Analytics/Hacking for Impact event held on March 24th 2018 in Brussels.

## Getting Started

The detailed instruction and goals were given by the slides provided during the hackthon. Unfortunately, I don't remember them well. However, the main task was to find a 'good' binary classification model with a higher predictability and draw some insights through the data-analysis.
